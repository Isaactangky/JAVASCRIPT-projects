### 13.Space Invader
*August 31, 2022*
#### Challenges: 
This is a classic space invader game. There are a group of alien invaders invading from the top of the space. The user has the ability to move the shooter to fight laser to eliminate the invaders. The user wins when all the invaders are killed and loses when the invader touch the shooter or the invaders pass through the bottom border. 

#### My Process:

1. Create a list of 'div's and append them to the div grid
2. Create a function to draw and remove the invaders
3. Create shooter for users, function for user to move the shooter and add event listener to Document to the function moveShooter
4. Create function to move the invaders and set the corresponding timeInterval
5. Create function for shooting laser and setting logics in eliminating the invaders, and pass it to another event listener of Document
6. Add the conditions for "GAME OVER" and "WIN"
7. Adjust the timer interval

#### Functions or Concepts Applied / learned:
- querySelector(), querySelectorAll(), addEventListener(), classList.contains(), .onclick(), classList.add(), classList.remove(), setTimeout(), setTimeInterval()
